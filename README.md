# WikiFiesta12

**The solution proposed is an api that scrapes automatically the latest climate news from WikiNews and integrates them in the app for the "Nuit de l'informatique".**





These script are for scraping data that talk about climate from the website en.Wikinews.org
the data is then cleaned and senf in json format via Restapi 
in our app we plan to use this in the news section

The web design could be improved by making it dynamic and flexible with the diffrent article images sizes (and the images should be better treadted to go with the design and don't lose their resolution)

These scripts can be automated to fetch new news every **"n" period**. or event transormfed to draw data in **real time**.
